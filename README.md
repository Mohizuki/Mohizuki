# Hi, I'm Crunchii

I'm currently on multiple projects include Animation, UI/UX, Illustration and Web develop projects.

This year I plan on continuing to work on some open source projects in my free time. I also have some ambitious projects that are very slowly being materialized on my disk. If I ever complete them, I'd be v happy
